# Azeez Daoud - Sorting Algorithms

## How to Visualize
Type `cargo run --release` (release mode is faster then debug)

You will be prompted with `Algorithm? ` to which you can type:
- `insertion`
- `selection`
- `pigeonhole`

to visualize the algorithm
## Supported Visualised Algorithms
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Pigeonhole Sort

(Merge sort is coming, hopefully)
